# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my blog! My name is Dan Co, a database administrator (DBA) currently based in Gold Coast, Australia ðŸ¦˜. I have 10+ years of professional experience in database system infrastructure/architecture design, SQL development (TSQL), and database performance optimization.

This blog will serve as my notes as I write my learnings and experiences along the way about SQL Server and other things I find it interesting to share.

Feedbacks are welcome. If you have any questions, suggestions, find any corrections about the contents on this blog, feel free to contact me via email at dan[at]codandn[dot]com ðŸ“§  or dm me on [twitter][1].
